* Split pages into seperate functions
* Declared port and host as global functions to be accessed
  in both the handle_connection and in main
* Created /form and /submit pages, and their respective tests
* Defined split_values to handle URL parsing for /form and /submit
  and possibly future use
* Enabled POST requests for /submit, and changed /form to a POST
* CONCERN: Should the arguement for all the pages be the variables 
           in dict form? Or should those be sorted out inside the
           page function?
